# Overview

## What is it all about?
This project is made in order to store and manage the Contact information of various connections via Command Line. It works in two modes, namely User mode and Admin mode. User mode allows you to only `List` and `Search` for the contact, while the Admin mode gives you the previlege to `Add`, `Edit` and `Delete` contacts along with the `List` and `Search` functionalities. There is also the functionality of adding new Admin. The project has been written in proper modules using the concepts of Classes and Objects, Abstraction, Encapsulation (Data Hiding), Getter and Setter methods for Password change and File Handling concepts to store the Contact Records.
